This is my first ever solo project.
I plan to make a new website at every stage of my dev course so I can monitor improvement and refine skills.
This site will include basic HTML and basic CSS to make a nice looking news site with some navigation capabilities.
I really want to push what I know albeit that I don't know a lot at this stage.

One major concern at this point for me is that I am not retaining all of the element names or some functionalities.
One major improvement for me is that I am able to comfortably set up the code for the site, write some code and get something on a page - which I wouldn't have been able to do 3-4 months ago.
